            Review Title:   Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)
            Review Date:    8/8/2011
            Review Summary: You'd be a silly monkey to miss this film ...            
        </h1>
        <h2>
            <p>
            The new movie RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES by Director Rupert Wyatt (The Escapist) is effectively a prequel<br>
            to the "Planet of the Apes" and tells the story of a lab that performs genetic engineering on animals to try to<br>
            get a cure for Alzheimer's – and of the consequences that occur when things go dramatically wrong<br>
            <br>
            A dedicated scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) is trying to discover a cure for Alzheimer's Disease by performing<br>
            tests on apes.<br>
            <br>
            One of these chimpanzees "Bright Eyes" soon becomes the "star of the show" of the medical trials and exceeds all<br>
            expectations for the new drug ALZ-112 – which has been developed to try and slow down / prevent Alzheimer's and shows<br>
            highly advanced intelligence, until a problem happens in the lab and she goes on a rampage and is killed. Unknown to<br>
            the lab owners – Bright Eyes had just given birth to a baby "Caesar" – who like his mother has also inherited all the<br>
            good things about the new drug – only this time without the bad side-effects. Caesar is smuggled out of the lab to<br>
            protect him when all the other chimps have been ordered to be destroyed.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile in the lab, ALZ-113 soon supersedes the original drug – but, it has one very unknown, dangerous side-effect<br>
            in that it is airborne, incredibly contagious and highly toxic to humans.<br>
            <br>
            As he grows, Caesar displays extra-ordinary intelligence – far exceeding even the intelligence of his mother and of<br>
            humans of a similar age. Will decides that the results on Caesar are so conclusive that he will treat his father<br>
            (John Lithgow), who is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's with the same drug which initially not only stops the disease<br>
            but starts to actually reverse the symptoms – until side-effects start appearing. Meanwhile, Ape sanctuary owner John Landon<br>
            (Brian Cox) – is compelled to take in Caesar after he attacks a next door neighbour that has been abusing Will's father.<br>
            <br>
            Caesar ultimately discovers where he came from and now knows why he has become so intelligent – and devises a plan to get<br>
            more of the ALZ-112 drug to give to his fellow apes. Caesar soon takes control of an ape army. Soon Caesar uses his superior<br>
            intelligence and skills to overthrow the brutal zoo keepers and arranges a mass break-out from the Ape Sanctuary and make their<br>
            bid for freedom.<br>
            <br>
            John Lithgow (Cliffhanger, Shrek series, 3rd rock from the Sun) and Brian Cox (Manhunter, Troy) are giants of the acting world -<br>
            but even these heavyweights were completely overshadowed by the performance of ANDY SERKIS (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, <br>
            Sex and Drugs and Rock n' Roll, King Kong, The Hobbit) as Caesar – who totally stole every scene he appeared in.<br>
            <br>
            James Franco (127 Hours, Eat Pray Love) as Will, and Freida Pinto – (Slumdog Millionaire) as the love interest Caroline give good<br>
            sound performances along with Tom Felton as Dodge – the brutal zoo keeper.<br>
            <br>
            The use of CGI created monkeys is very good and convincing especially for the close up shots and the battle scenes). The facial<br>
            expressions and mannerisms of the actors far exceed anything that has been seen before – they are really believable.<br>
            <br>
            Though most of these events – especially the portrayal of the monkeys by Andy Serkis and Co. is so convincing that you feel compelled<br>
            to be on the monkeys side!<br>
            <br>
            I feel that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES could easily kick-start the flagging Planet of the Apes franchise – hopefully, they would<br>
            all be films of the high quality and caliber of this film.<br>
            <br>
            RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is 105mins long, is a PG-12A certificate and will be on general release from Thurs 11th August, 2011<br>
