            Review Title:   Stake Land (2010)
            Review Date:    8/6/2011
            Review Summary: Not a film to sink your teeth into
        </h1>
        <h2>
            <p>
            STAKE LAND from Director Jim Mickle this vampire / zombie horror flick tells the story of an unstoppable vampire<br>
            / zombie plague epidemic that spreads across America (and I presume the world?), and our band of gallant survivors<br>
            have to battle their way through the hoards of zombies through to "New Eden" (Canada) where the plague hasn't yet<br>
            taken hold. Hmmm ... now where have I heard this plot line before ? (28 Days Later, I am Legend, and numerous others)<br>
            <br>
            Within the first two minutes, Martin's family is killed by zombies, and he himself only survives because of the<br>
            intervention of a mysterious stranger "Mister", a self-styled vampire stalker / executioner who comes to his aid.<br>
            <br>
            Mister and Martin realise that their chances are better together than apart, so they strike up an unlikely partnership<br>
            in their quest to get to New Eden.<br>
            <br>
            Their journey leads them through remote towns of America's heartland, to other fearful survivors that cling together in<br>
            rural pockets, fearful of nightfall (when the vampires attack).<br>
            <br>
            Cautiously moving ever north, using back roads, avoiding populated areas they pick up rag-tag stragglers along the way,<br>
            including a nun (Kelly McGillis) who they rescue as she is being attacked by rapists, Belle – a pregnant teenager,<br>
            Willie – an ex-marine and Peggy the sole survivor of a family that was attacked by the vampires.<br>
            <br>
            Another danger they face is the Brethren, a fundamentalist militia headed by Jebedia Loven that interprets the plague as<br>
            the Lord's work. Jebedia and his followers consider Mister as a mortal enemy, as one of the rapists Mister killed was<br>
            Jebedia's son.<br>
            <br>
            So much for the summary / pretext of the story, now to the REAL part of the review ... this film (which is really being<br>
            "bigged-up" by a huge advertising campaign is a bitter disappointment ... it is a real pile of drivel<br>
            <br>
            Whoever wrote the music score for this film needs shooting, as it was totally inconsistent with what action was taking place<br>
            the direction, script, casting, acting, editing and photography were truly woeful<br>
            <br>
            There really is nothing positive to recommend this movie The ONLY actor to any semblance of credibility was Michael Cerveris<br>
            who played the role of Jebedia Loven the twisted leader of the "Brethren"<br>
            <br>
            Everybody else should rapidly remove this movie from their CV's if they would like to work again<br>
            <br>
            STAKE LAND adds nothing new ... it's a very poor film, it is not even scary, and it went down well in the US (Quelle surprise!)<br>
            but that probably says more about American tastes than the quality of the film<br>
            <br>
            I expect this film to "bomb" over here, as word of mouth will NOT sell this film ... it is definitely not a film to sink your teeth into<br>
