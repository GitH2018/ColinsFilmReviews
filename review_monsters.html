        <h2>
            <p>
            We saw this film MONSTERS in a great atmosphere (at the Royal College of Surgeons), Jameson's Irish Whisky were<br>
            sponsoring the event as part of their Jameson's Cult Film Club series - and there were some very "happy" people<br>
            around, there was a lot of war / military zone type decorations up in the reception area and the bar, a lot of<br>
            the staff were in anti-contamination suits and gas masks – really getting into the swing of the theme of the<br>
            film – which was based on a Year 2000 "Infected Zone" quarantined off between Mexico and the US, that was full<br>
            of new life forms - monsters from Mars!<br>
            <br>
            To get us more in the mood before the show started were treated by some of the staff, to a "live" mock interview<br>
            by a "CNN reporter" talking to two tourists who had just "experienced" travelling through the "Infected Zone"<br>
            (quite comic really!)<br>
            <br>
            This was followed by a Q&A session with the MONSTERS Director (GARETH EDWARDS) and the films editor COLIN GOUDIE<br>
            – who told us more about the making of the film and what they were trying to achieve<br>
            <br>
            The premise of MONSTERS is that six years ago, NASA discovered the possibility of alien life within our solar system.<br>
            A probe was launched to collect samples, but crashed upon re-entry over Central America. Soon after, new life form began<br>
            to appear and half of Mexico was quarantined as an "INFECTED ZONE". Today, the American and Mexican military still struggle<br>
            to contain "the creatures"......<br>
            <br>
            Our story begins when a US photo-journalist Andrew Kaulder begrudgingly agrees to escort a wayward tourist Samantha Wynden<br>
            (who just happens to be the daughter of his boss), through the infected zone in Mexico to the safety of the US border.<br>
            <br>
            There is no real story / plot as such – and you don't actually see any monsters until quite late into the film – the idea<br>
            is more about the build up of "suspense" as to what will happens when they eventually come across the monsters – rather than<br>
            the monsters themselves (a big tribute to Jaws here – as mentioned by the Director in the Q&A before the film started) and<br>
            that the fact that the creatures moved around mostly at night – meant a lot of suspense build up was achieved with sound effects<br>
            this could make the film appear a little dark on occasion<br>
            <br>
            Whitney Able (as Samantha) is very pleasant on the eye and acted quite well considering what she had to work with and should go<br>
            onto better things, Scoot McNairy (as Andrew) was a little more rough around the edges but was fine in this film. An interesting<br>
            sub-plot of MONSTERS is the growing relationship between these two main lead characters.<br>
            <br>
            All other characters in the film were un-credited and were basically locals hired by the director on the days of shooting – and<br>
            were just asked to play themselves – or to act out scenes that the director wished to shoot that day<br>
            <br>
            The cinematography is pretty much "hand-held" throughout, following the action through the eyes of the couple themselves and<br>
            always on the move – which adds to the build up of tension<br>
            <br>
            I actually quite liked MONSTERS, but I wouldn't class it as a main stream film. I think Jameson's were quite right to class MONSTERS<br>
            as one of their "cult" films – because, with this audience, that was really "up for the gig" it went down VERY WELL on the night<br>
            especially for the way that the whisky, the pre-amble interview, the décor, the whisky, decontaminations suits, the whisky, gas masks,<br>
            Q&A session with the Director and Film Editor all set the ambiance so well, it was all really well received ...<br>
            <br>
            Oh, ... and did I mention the whisky!<br>
            <br>
            MONSTERS is 94mins long, is an R certificate and will be on general release from 1st December 2010<br>
