        <h2>
            <p>
            WEST IS WEST, directed by ANDY DE EMMONY continues on from the 1999 hit film East is East (which was set in 1971).<br>
            <br>
            It is now 1976, in Salford, Manchester, England, and remaining members of the Khan family soldier on through their<br>
            in-house, on-going struggle of the elder family members tradition Pakistani values and beliefs vs. the youngsters<br>
            who were born in Britain and have an avid acceptance into the British culture<br>
            <br>
            In the midst of this turmoil is the story of Sajid the youngest of the children who is now a teenager and is enduring<br>
            some serious bullying at school<br>
            <br>
            Many of the original cast from East is East make a welcome return including OM PURI as George Khan, LINDA BASSETT as<br>
            Ella, JIMI MISTRY, as Tariq, LESLEY NICOL as Auntie Annie, and EMIL MARWA as Maneer and the film introduces a new face<br>
            to the ongoing Khan family story AQIB KHAN as Sajid Khan.<br>
            <br>
            George Khan is still very much acting as the family dictator – enforcing his beliefs upon his family – much to their<br>
            disdain it is especially bad for Sajid and events soon come to a head, and George believes it would benefit him to take<br>
            a trip to Pakistan to instill some much needed cultural discipline, in fact most of the film is set in rural Pakistan<br>
            <br>
            Sajid, as expected, is uncomfortable and feels very much out of place in Pakistan, and has much difficulty in fitting in<br>
            the surprise however comes in the dramatic change that comes over George when he sees Mrs Khan No 1 (played very<br>
            convincingly by ILA ARUN) and family in the Punjab, these are the wife and daughters he had abandoned 30 years earlier<br>
            when he left to go to England. We soon discover that it is actually George who is most changed by the visit.<br>
            <br>
            Pretty soon, George decides to make up for some of his many, many shortcomings and decides to build a house and re-work<br>
            the land Sajid finally starts to bond with some friends<br>
            <br>
            The pace of the film slows a little at this point, but only for a short while that is, until the ominous arrival from<br>
            England of Ella Khan (Mrs Khan No 2), along with the hilarious Auntie Annie who swiftly follow to sort out the mess George<br>
            has created – both past and present<br>
            <br>
            There is an especially good scene between the two Mrs. Khans (past and present), who have a very moving dialogue (one only<br>
            speaking Punjhabi, the other only English), but all that needs to be said is expressed with emotion and body language, it<br>
            is superbly acted, and to me, it's the best moment in the film<br>
            <br>
            I found WEST TO WEST to be an enjoyable, moving sequel – and recommend it highly! especially likable to those that enjoyed<br>
            EAST is EAST.<br>
            <br>
            WEST IS WEST is 102mins long, is a 15 certificate and will be on general release from Friday 25th February 2011<br>
