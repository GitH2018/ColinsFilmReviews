Review Summary: It's a hit with me!

COLUMBIANA by Director Oliver Megaton (Transporter 3) tells the story of a young girl, who after witnessing the
cold-blooded murder of her parents by a rival drug cartel boss vows to reap revenge on their killers.

In a brisk, but action-packed opening to the film, 9 year old Cataleya escapes the fatal mob hit on her family –
and takes refuge with her uncle in California. Here she makes plain her desire for revenge and asks her Uncle
(also a mob boss) to "educate" her in the ways of the mob.

As Cataleya gets more adept, and skillful in her trade, she (in addition to working for her uncle as a hit-woman
by day), then also starts to take out members of the mob that murdered her parents in her part time.

Cataleya soon becomes so successful at her "trade" that she has taken out 22 gang members in 4 years – which
raises alarm bells – and soon she is on the radar of the police, the FBI, SWAT, and the various mobs.

Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Star Trek XI, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl) excels in the lead role,
she is very sexy, is a very able actress, and plays Cataleya so adeptly, that you would have thought that this
was a role specifically written for her. She commands every scene she is in, with grace, style and vigour – to
make the part one of the strongest women's lead roles I've seen for ages. This is an actress that will go far.

Credit should also go to Amandla Stenberg who plays an excellent role in the portrayal of the young Cataleya.

COLUMBIANA is 107mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday, 9th Sept 2011,
and is well recommended as a good action thriller with a twist.
