        <h2>
            <p>
            TRUE GRIT is a Coen Brothers re-make of the classic 1969 movie that starred John Wayne.<br>
            <br>
            In this new adaptation, Oscar winner JEFF BRIDGES (The Big Lebowski, TRON, Crazy Heart) takes the reins in the<br>
            lead role of US Marshall Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn, an aging bad-tempered bully of a man, now well past his prime<br>
            who seems more interested in whisky than in law enforcement.<br>
            <br>
            Rooster's life is plodding along at his preferred languid, mellow pace until he is confronted by a 14 year old<br>
            schoolgirl Mattie Ross (ably played by newcomer HAILEE STEINFELD), who hires him and then demands that he bring to<br>
            justice Tom Chaney a member of the "Lucky" Ned Pepper gang and the killer of her father. Mattie is very determined<br>
            and gets her way to ride along with Rooster on his quest (much against his better judgement)<br>
            <br>
            Along for the ride, is US Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (played by MATT DAMON – The Bourne Trilogy, The Departed, The Talented<br>
            Mr. Ripley) who is also after Tom Chaney – for the killing of a Senator up in Texas. The rest of the film is really about<br>
            the adventure of the pursuit of the Lucky Ned Pepper gang<br>
            <br>
            Although some of the performances were good (noteably Hailee Steinfeld), I thought that Matt Damon in particular looked<br>
            quite miscast – he really didn't look to comfortable or convincing in the role of LaBoeuf and I got the feeling that the<br>
            "baddies" just weren't bad enough, on occasion they were just too darn polite.<br>
            <br>
            I gather that Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld have been Oscar nominated for TRUE GRIT, I feel that might be a tad ambitious.<br>
            <br>
            I was looking forwards to TRUE GRIT, but I found that this film was an almost word for word remake, hardly anything was<br>
            different to the original – no extra dimensions seemed to have been added or improved upon. On it's own merits as a standalone<br>
            film, I would have scored TRUE GRIT higher, BUT – due to the fact that this is a re-make of an existing film classic – by<br>
            the usually very talented Coen Brothers, I really don't believe that it added anything to the much, much better original<br>
            <br>
            TRUE GRIT is 110mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday 11th February 2011<br>
