            <p>
            There was a good atmosphere in the audience at the start of this film as it was introduced by Stuart Brennan<br>
            who plays the lead role in the film, the part of Howard Winstone, with the promise of a Q & A session after the<br>
            film with director Neil Jones and Stuart Brennan.<br>
            <br>
            RISEN by director Neil Jones, and written by Jones and Stuart Brennan, is the moving, true story of the rising<br>
            talents of an the young boxer Howard Winstone (later to become an MBE), the boy from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales, who<br>
            was rapidly rising the amateur featherweight ranks as a fighter of some standing with a fearsome right hand,<br>
            <br>
            The future beckoned great things for young Howard until a tragic accident in his workplace that saw him lose the<br>
            top half of three of the fingers on his right hand, but, even such a cruel twist of fate was merely a temporary set<br>
            back for Howard, who, when goaded on by his parents, teamed up with boxing trainer Eddie Thomas (himself a former<br>
            European Welterweight champion) who taught him an alternative way to fight, so that he could still compete in the boxing ring.<br>
            <br>
            Through sheer guts, and determination, and using his new fighting style Howard continued to be successful, being<br>
            unbeaten in 6 years and winning 83 out of 86 amateur matches. Howard soon turns professional and after another 24 straight wins,<br>
            he gets a shot at the British Featherweight title against Terry Spinks, which he wins and then goes onto be champion of Europe.<br>
            <br>
            Soon, the next big hurdle is the Featherweight Championship of the World ...<br>
            <br>
            What makes this film stand out is the performances of the characters in the leading roles – Stuart Brennan is excellent as<br>
            Howard Winstone, John Noble is very convincing as the trainer Eddie Thomas, and Grainne Joughin as Howard's Wife Bennita<br>
            there are some fine performances all round by a very well chosen cast.<br>
            <br>
            I declare now, that I am not really a fan of boxing – but this film has a lot more to it than that it shows remarkable courage,<br>
            determination against tremendous odds and set-backs, it has some quite emotional sequences – even during "the thick of the action"<br>
            my favourite stand-out scene was during the third World title fight against Vicente Saldivar – when the world, the crowd and<br>
            everything else just seemed to fade away, leaving just two giants of the ring slugging it out in slow motion with a backing track<br>
            of Beethoven's moonlight sonata ... it was really quite an emotive scene ...<br>
            <br>
            The direction was sensitive to the subject matter (the Director also hails from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales) the scenery and ambiance<br>
            was great, music, acting all pretty accomplished.<br>
            <br>
            In the Q & A session after the film, we met, listened to, and asked questions of Director Neil Jones and Stuart Brennan, who both<br>
            wrote the screenplay, they were very open to questions and they told us of the difficulties (mostly due to funding) of making this<br>
            five year labour of love, and it was obvious to all there the passion that these guys had for this film and the subject matter, and<br>
            it certainly shows through in the finished result. The fight scenes were really quite intimate as well with some very close up camera<br>
            action – and we're assured that the actors really did make contact on several occasions – they weren't just acting ... and some of that<br>
            blood was real!<br>
            <br>
            I would recommend RISEN to fight fans and for those that would want to see a really well told biopic of a truly courageous, and<br>
            remarkable man Howard Winstone MBE.<br>
            <br>
            RISEN is 90mins long, is a 12A certificate and will be on general release from May 2011<br>
