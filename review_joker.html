            Review Summary: Not much to laugh about

            MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br>
            ******************************<br>
            Joker is a VERY predictable film that openly plagiarised other films, particularly Martin Scorsese's<br>
            THE KING OF COMEDY and Brad Anderson's THE MACHINIST, and whoever choose the totally inappropriate music<br>
            score needs shooting.<br>
            <br>
            Joker is a hard watch, NOT, because of its action (or distinct lack of it), but because it is VERY dark and<br>
            just depressing throughout.<br>
            <br>
            Not a lot of thought seems to have gone into this picture which based around a very flimsy, simplistic plotline.<br>
            <br>
            Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a socially inept, grotesque and emanciated outcast living at home with his ailing<br>
            Mother, works as a children's clown and as a part time human advertising slogan board for local two-bit shops and<br>
            businesses. He suffers from a medical condition (evidently a form of Asperger's syndrome) that causes him to laugh<br>
            manically and uncontrollably at the most inappropriate times getting him into a series of sticky situations and<br>
            violent beatings.<br>
            <br>
            Arthur's only hope for salvation (he believes) is to succeed in comedy - an art at which he sucks. His hero is the<br>
            talk show host Murray Franklin (played by Robert De Niro - in an almost mirror image of his portrayal in Martin Scorsese's<br>
            KING OF COMEDY).<br>
            <br>
            The frequent beatings continue unabated, until eventually (and so VERY predictably) the worm turns ... and Arthur (whilst<br>
            still in his clown's make-up) fights back and kills three assailants on a subway train ... which, (inexplicably) leads to<br>
            a sizeable faction of down and outs and criminals in Gotham City rising up, to praise the "Killer Clown" and they start <br>
            rioting against society.<br>
            <br>
            Murray Franklin notices Arthur in one of his show's audience and chats to him on-stage, leading to what Arthur believes a<br>
            connection between them.<br>
            <br>
            The Gotham riots continue support of the Killer Clown antics and killings which escalate and get much closer to home after<br>
            Arthur loses his job. Eventually, Arthur gets his dream big break, with a guest slot on the Murray Franklin show ... but,<br>
            by now, he wants to be introduced as Joker. When Joker realises that he is being laughed AT rather than laughed WITH, the<br>
            Joker takes a terrible revenge.<br>
            <br>
            Ultimately, Joker, as a film ... quite simply ... JUST DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH, into what COULD HAVE BEEN, with a bit more<br>
            forethought and a much better script/director, an intriguing insight into what would be the REAL motivation behind what<br>
            would create a character like the Joker and his ultimate downward spiral into madness.<br>
            <br>
            Joaquin Phoenix may have lost 24kg to play the role as the emanciated anti-hero... but, I just can't help comparing on just<br>
            how much better Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson were as the Joker.<br>
