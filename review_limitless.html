            Review Title:   Limitless (2011)
            Review Date:    22/3/2011
            Review Summary: Compelling viewing ...            
        </h1>
        <h2>
            <p>
            Directed by NEIL BURGER (The Illusionist), LIMITLESS is a fast-paced thriller that tells the story of hopeful,<br>
            but failed writer Eddie Morra (played by BRADLEY COOPER) – who, during a chance meeting, discovers a new drug NZT48<br>
            that expands his minds capacity (from the usual 20%) so much he can use his brain up to 100% with much greater efficiency<br>
            <br>
            Eddie then starts on a rapid upward spiral in everything he does – succeeding at all tasks that he puts his mind to<br>
            <br>
            Pretty soon Eddie realizes that the drug is starting to change everything about himself – and he realizes that he has<br>
            become "super focused" and has a "total recall" of everything he has ever read, seen or done, an ability that he uses<br>
            very successfully to his profitable advantage and business tycoon Carl Van Loon (ROBERT DE NIRO – The godfather, <br>
            Raging Bull) is quick to recognise Eddie as the ultimate money making machine<br>
            <br>
            But, not everything goes well, and soon after suffering from some of the drug's side-effects, and the realization of<br>
            his growing dependency on his "fix", Eddie decides to find out more about where the drug comes from – meanwhile, Eddie's<br>
            success is getting noticed in some very seedy quarters by mobsters who also want part of the action<br>
            <br>
            After seeing BRADLEY COOPER in The A-Team, and the Hangover (both fairly effortless / "passable" movies – with little<br>
            thinking required), I wasn't expecting much from him in this film, but, as it turned out I was very impressed, it has<br>
            a good plot, is thought-provoking and has plenty of twists and turns (akin to Usual Suspects / Memento) to surprise the<br>
            audience along the way. I think it is Cooper's best film so far, which bodes well because he is in pretty much every scene<br>
            of this film – and in some scenes there is even more than one of him in the scene!<br>
            <br>
            Top marks should go to the script which was very well written, the direction very well paced and structured,<br>
            the camera work and visual effects were excellent, the music also builds up the tension nicely in this finely<br>
            crafted thriller.<br>
            <br>
            Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro are convincing in their roles, and they were ably supported by a fine supporting<br>
            cast – specific mentions go to ABBIE CORNISH (Bright Star) as Lindy, ANNA FRIEL (The Street, Bathory) as the brief<br>
            ex-wife Melissa, ANDREW HOWARD – as the very convincing "baddie" Gennady, and JOHNNY WHITWORTH as the ex<br>
            Brother-in-Law Vernon.<br>
            <br>
            I noticed from the credits that Bradley Cooper was one of the Producers of LIMITLESS, so he is really putting his money<br>
            where his mouth is, and in this instance, I believe he has made a very wise investment, and I would expect LIMITLESS to<br>
            do very well at the box-office. I wouldn't be at all surprised if this was one of the biggest grossing films this year<br>
            <br>
            LIMITLESS is 105 mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on UK general release from 23rd March 2011<br>
