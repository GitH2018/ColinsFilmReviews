            Review Title:   Colombiana (2011)
            Review Date:    20/8/2011
            Review Summary: It's a hit with me!
        </h1>
        <h2>
            <p>
            COLUMBIANA by Director Oliver Megaton (Transporter 3) tells the story of a young girl, who after witnessing the<br>
            cold-blooded murder of her parents by a rival drug cartel boss vows to reap revenge on their killers.<br>
            <br>
            In a brisk, but action-packed opening to the film, 9 year old Cataleya escapes the fatal mob hit on her family<br>
            and takes refuge with her uncle in California. Here she makes plain her desire for revenge and asks her Uncle<br>
            (also a mob boss) to "educate" her in the ways of the mob.<br>
            <br>
            As Cataleya gets more adept, and skillful in her trade, she (in addition to working for her uncle as a hit-woman<br>
            by day), then also starts to take out members of the mob that murdered her parents in her part time.<br>
            <br>
            Cataleya soon becomes so successful at her "trade" that she has taken out 22 gang members in 4 years – which<br>
            raises alarm bells – and soon she is on the radar of the police, the FBI, SWAT, and the various mobs.<br>
            <br>
            Zoe Saldana (Avatar, Star Trek XI, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl) excels in the lead role,<br>
            she is very sexy, is a very able actress, and plays Cataleya so adeptly, that you would have thought that this<br>
            was a role specifically written for her. She commands every scene she is in, with grace, style and vigour – to<br>
            make the part one of the strongest women's lead roles I've seen for ages. This is an actress that will go far.<br>
            <br>            
            Credit should also go to Amandla Stenberg who plays an excellent role in the portrayal of the young Cataleya.<br>
            <br>            
            COLUMBIANA is 107mins long, is a PG-13 certificate and will be on general release from Friday, 9th Sept 2011,<br>
            and is well recommended as a good action thriller with a twist.<br>
